<!-- he "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out 
the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their 
way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and 
for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are 
multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”." -->
